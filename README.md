Welcome to the ELECTRICA Ontology GitHub repository! This repository contains the resources and documentation for the ELECTRICA ontology, designed to describe data for ELEctronic tool for Clinicians, Teachers and Researchers In Child Abuse. The aim of the ontology is to standardise and facilitate the organisation, integration, and analysis of data related to pediatric fractures and potential child abuse cases.

### Overview
The ELECTRICA ontology describes concepts from reports of cases of child abuse or suspected child abuse, with a focus on fractures identified from radiological investigations, the characteristics of those fractures, and the family and medical history of the patients. At the time of writing, the ontology includes 1141 classes and 63 properties. 

### Usage

#### Viewing the Ontology
To get started with the ELECTRICA ontology, clone this repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/fatibaba/electrica.git
```
You will need [Protégé](https://protege.stanford.edu) to view and modify the ontology files.

1. Open Protégé.
2. Load the electrica.owl file from the cloned repository.

#### Access via BioPortal
The ELECTRICA ontology can also be accessed via BioPortal at [ELECTRICA on BioPortal](https://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/ELECTRICA). BioPortal provides built-in functionalities to view and explore the concepts within the ontology. Users can:

1. Browse the ontology's hierarchy to understand its structure.
2. Use the search functionality to find specific classes or properties.
3. Explore detailed information about each concept, including definitions, synonyms, and mappings to other ontologies.
4. Utilise visualisation tools to see the relationships between different concepts.
