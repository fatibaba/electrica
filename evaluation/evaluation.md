### Results of Ontology Evaluation

The comprehensive evaluation of the ELECTRICA ontology yielded positive results, affirming its accuracy, consistency, and completeness. The iterative feedback process with domain experts proved invaluable, leading to significant refinements in the ontology. The experts' insights ensured that the ontology accurately captured the nuances of pediatric fractures and the associated clinical and investigative details.

The validation of the ontology against the competency questions through SPARQL queries on annotated datasets demonstrated that the ontology could effectively retrieve and represent the required information. The successful execution of these queries confirmed that the ontology met its intended purpose and could support detailed and accurate data analysis.

The use of the OntOlogy Pitfall Scanner! (OOPS!) revealed several areas for improvement, such as missing labels and minor hierarchical inconsistencies. These issues were promptly addressed, leading to a more robust and user-friendly ontology. The OOPS! tool also highlighted a few redundant classes, which were subsequently merged or removed to streamline the ontology structure.

The logical consistency of the ontology was verified using Pellet and HermiT reasoners. These reasoners detected no unsatisfiable classes or major logical issues, indicating that the ontology maintained a coherent and error-free structure. Minor logical inconsistencies identified were resolved, ensuring that the ontology's logic was sound and reliable.

Overall, the evaluation results confirmed that the ELECTRICA ontology is a well-structured, accurate, and comprehensive tool for representing and analyzing data related to pediatric fractures and potential child abuse. The rigorous validation process and the use of automated tools and expert feedback ensured that the ontology is fit for its intended purpose, providing a reliable foundation for clinical and research applications.
